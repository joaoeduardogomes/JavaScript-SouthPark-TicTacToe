# South Park â€” Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game that replaces the traditional "X" and "O" markers with avatars of South Park animation characters.

## Project Goal

I aimed to enhance my JavaScript skills by taking on the challenge of completing this project, which is recommended by more experienced programmers as an excellent exercise. Instead of using the typical "X" and "O" markers, I decided to create a game that features images of South Park characters.

## Lessons learned & challenges

Understanding the logic behind a tic-tac-toe game proved to be quite challenging. Despite its simple concept, translating it into programming logic was tough for me. Through a combination of research and a lot of trial and error, I gradually grasped where I went wrong and how to proceed.
